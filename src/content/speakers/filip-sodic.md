Hi, I'm Filip! I'm a founding engineer and a core maintainer at Wasp, an open-source web framework. I'm also a big fan of the web, compilers, and functional programming.

I believe in learning and using a language to its full potential, regardless of whether I'm talking to a computer or with another human.

When not working on Wasp, I teach Haskell and functional programming at a local university.
