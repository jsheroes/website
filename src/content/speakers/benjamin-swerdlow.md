My name's Ben. I'm 20, a Senior Backend Engineer contractor for Apple, and in my free time I'm a full time student at the University of Chicago. As a high school student I was a technical lead for the World Health Organization COVID-19 App Team.

Iâ€™m a web enthusiast and a functional code evangelist. I introduced and brought Rust to production for the first time for my department.
