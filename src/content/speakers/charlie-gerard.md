Charlie Gerard is a staff engineer at Socket, the author of "Practical Machine Learning in JavaScript with TensorFlow.js" and overall, a creative technologist. For the past decade, sheâ€™s built side projects pushing the boundaries of what can be done using JavaScript. From building brain-controlled web interfaces, to creating a custom motion detection machine learning model to play Street Fighter with body movements, to now exploring cybersecurity, she loves experimenting with web technologies. When she's not coding, she likes to spend time outdoors and try things she's never done before.
