Bramus Van Damme is a web developer from Belgium. From the moment he discovered `view-source` at the age of 14 _(way back in 1997)_, he **fell in love with the web** and has been tinkering with it ever since.

As a **Chrome Developer Relations Engineer at Google**, he spreads the word on CSS, UI, and DevTools. Before joining Google, Bramus worked as a freelance developer in various front- and backend roles. For seven years he also was a College Lecturer **Web & Mobile**, educating undergrad students all about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” [in that order](https://css-tricks.com/embrace-the-platform/).
