Cyd creates accessible, creative, award winning websites for individuals and companies.

Sharing knowledge is big part of what she likes about being a developer. She does that by blogging, at meetups, conferences and by teaching the next generation of web developers at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences at the Associate Degree Frontend Design & Development and the Minor Web Design & Development.
