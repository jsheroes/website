With a passion for reshaping processes and being able to produce more by doing less, Jean works mainly as a domain-specific reference on the JavaScript/Node.js ecosystem, leading platform and transversal teams.

When he is not directly building features for the business, Jean finds solutions to improve the global developer experience by enhancing the collaboration between teams, bringing suggestions on how to succeed together, bring more efficiency to all teams and focus on the technical stack. Outside of the company work Jean spend a good amount of time to teach to Computer Science students, present to both in-company guilds and meetups and being involved on Open-Source projects.
