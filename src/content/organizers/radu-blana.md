Radu joined the JSHeroes community in 2023 and never looked back. He appreciates the high level of interest, commitment, and fun that everybody in the JSHeroes ecosystem promotes, and is keen to be at its core for the years to come. He is passionate about everything in the Web space, from the bare bits that built up UIs, to UX research and design, developer productivity, healthy work environments and many more. During the event he helps looking after the speakers, making sure that the flow of the conference is as good on stage as it is back-stage.
Radu is a UI Developer turned UX designer and Product Owner, currently setting up the bases of a technology consulting business called Bridgeford.
