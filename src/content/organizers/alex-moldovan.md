Alex is one of the founders of JSHeroes and coordinates the effort behind the content of each edition. During the event, he will occasionally pick up the microphone and introduce speakers, but he prefers to keep a watchful eye over the conference, to make sure everything is on time and the event is as smooth as possible.

He works as a Frontend Engineer at CodeSandbox, where he gets to practice his passion for both sides of the user experience vs developer experience dilemma.
