Ana is a dedicated volunteer who has been involved with the JSHeroes conference from the very beginning. Her initial role was to take care of the traveling arrangements of the conference speakers, earning her the affectionate nickname "trip advisor".
However, Ana's life changed when she became a mother, which made it challenging for her to continue with her initial responsibilities. Nevertheless, she remained committed to the conference and continued to volunteer her time whenever she could, taking on any tasks that were available.

Despite the challenges of motherhood and the demands of her busy schedule, Ana remained dedicated to the conference and always showed up with a positive attitude and a willingness to help wherever needed. Her hard work and dedication were greatly appreciated by everyone involved, and she was admired for her ability to balance multiple responsibilities and still make time to give back to the community.
