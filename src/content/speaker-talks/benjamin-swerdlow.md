title: "Better Together: Rust & TypeScript"
---

This talk explores the lessons learned I learned from Rust, a language renowned for its safety and performance, and how these lessons can be applied to improve TypeScript development. While Rust and TypeScript are different in many ways, the principles and best practices from Rust can significantly enhance the way developers approach TypeScript coding, leading to more robust, efficient, and maintainable applications.
