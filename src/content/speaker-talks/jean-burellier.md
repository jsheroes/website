The Node.js world celebrated its 15 years this year, with the Express Framework turning the same age next January. Strong of more than a decade of experience, the Express ecosystem is one of the bigger of the JavaScript world, with close to 55 billions downloads a year.

With the now released released Express 5.0, we plan to bring significant performance and security improvements while also signaling back to the community the next steps of the modernization of the framework.
Let's see all the current work being done to achieve version 5.0, including Express CITGM in Node.js, the change of governance and how the project was revivified during the year.

With a new technical committee, captains, triagers and goal, this talk will focus on the work that was done, but most importantly the next steps leading to Express 6.0 and 7.0, paving the way for a more sustainable and efficient Express.js ecosystem.

Used by everyone, but maintained only by a small number of people, let's dive into the news around the new Express.js version 5 - the first major released since 2014. Performance, security but also sustainability are core topics for this new version.
