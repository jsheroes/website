title: The intentions were good
---

We hope for our web applications to be as beautiful, performant, and accessible as possible; but sometimes... Things get in the way and the outcome is not as good as we hoped. In this talk I'll walk you through a few of my failed attempts at developing accessible web applications. We'll go through different accessibility assumptions and myths that I wrongly believed to be true and how to avoid them by properly testing for accessibility.

This talk aims to be a reminder about the fact that, more often than not, inaccessible applications are a result of lack of knowledge, not lack of caring. That it is ok to make mistakes, but it is also essential to avoid making the same mistake twice.
