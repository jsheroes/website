title: Building hacking tools in JavaScript
---

If we follow Atwood’s Law, “Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript”. As I started studying cybersecurity in my personal time, I noticed that the tools available to hackers  are usually coded in C, C++ or Python but, as a front-end developer, I started wondering… Wouldn’t it be cool to rebuild some of these tools in JavaScript instead?! In this talk, I will show how I rebuilt a famous tool to hack wireless devices using only Web APIs so you can hack doorbells, garage doors and more right from the browser!
