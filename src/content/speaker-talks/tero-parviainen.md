title: Making Minimal Techno with WebAssembly And a C Compiler
---

The C programming language, a cornerstone of computing, originated in the early 1970s. Meanwhile, techno music with its roots in 1980s Detroit, has been with us as an always-evolving phenomenon ever since. These enduring artifacts of cultural creativity have not only survived but thrived over the decades.

On the other hand, WebAssembly and Audio Worklets represent some of the latest advancements of the web platform, only having been widely supported for a small handful of years.

In this session we’re going to smash the old together with the new to make some creative sparks appear. Equipped with nothing but a C to WASM compiler and a standard web browser, we’re going to conjure some minimal techno into being. We’ll see that you don’t necessarily need anything new or anything big to make something cool. There’s a lot of value in the minimal and the mature.
