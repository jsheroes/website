title: "Blink and you’ll miss it: Stories from discovering most annoying bugs and test flakes"
---

Some bugs just tend to hide when you look at them. We’ve all experienced a 3 hour bug-hunt that lead to nowhere and made us question our skills. In my talk, I would like to share some of the most annoying bugs and test flakes that I have encountered in my time as SDET and walk you through a process of how to make debugging faster and - believe it or not - fun. I’d like to share my tips on how to narrow down a bug, test flake and demonstrate how to use a time-machine debugger called Replay.io to identify the root cause.
