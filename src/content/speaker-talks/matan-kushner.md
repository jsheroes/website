title: Console.loggers Anonymous â€“ A Debugging Roadmap from Local to Production
---

console.log("<-- INTRO HOOK");

Console.log: a JavaScript developer's old friend. While it's tried and true, it often feels like blindly probing at your running code.

console.log("<-- PROBLEM STATEMENT");

Don't you just wish you could skip it all and peer into your running application? Maybe you've used the debugger before, but what about in production? How can you find the source of a bug when it's affecting your users?

console.log("<-- MEAT AND POTATOES");

In this talk, we'll give an overview on the landscape of debugging tools in the JS ecosystem used in both local development and production. We'll dissect logging, tracing, instrumentation, and profilers, exploring how these tools can provide profound insights into your running code. You'll see these tools in action, helping you understand their power and ease of use.
