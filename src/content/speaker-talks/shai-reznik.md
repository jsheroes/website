title: JavaScript Streaming - a Qwik Glimpse into an AI Optimized future
---

"Wait... I don't have to write all this code and my users still get the best experience possible? ... It's like my code is auto-optimizing itself!"

That's exactly how I felt when I first learned about "JavaScript Streaming" - a new way to build for the web that feels almost like magic.

It also helped me answer a big question:
"What's next for web development, and where should I invest my time to prepare for the future?"

In this session (or should I say, magic show?), I’ll take you on a journey through my decision to join the innovative Qwik framework, how it's philosophy is going to change our lives as web developers forever, and show it in action.

Get ready to learn, laugh, and get inspired about what’s next for the web!
