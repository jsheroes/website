title: "The hidden framework revolution: the comeback of RPC"
---

A major shift is taking place in frontend programming that is mostly going unnoticed: the comeback of RPC (Remote Procedure Call). Leading frameworks, such as React, Qwik and Solid are embracing RPC as the preferred mechanism for accessing backend services and sending data from the frontend in the form of server components, server actions, and server functions. This is surprising because RPC used to be big in the 90s but fell out of favor when the Web took off, replaced by protocols such as REST and GraphQL. Now RPC is back and replacing these protocols instead. What’s driving this resurgence? Why is it happening now? What’s its impact on the way we implement frontends? In this talk I will answer these questions and explain how to achieve the benefits of RPC, avoid its limitations and make the most from this technological comeback.
