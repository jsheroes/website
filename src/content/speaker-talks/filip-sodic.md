title: "Treat the Compiler With Compassion"
---

The compiler is your friend.

Even when you think it's out to get you, chances are it's just misunderstood. Before diving into the inner workings of TypeScript, I used to spend more time than I care to admit cluelessly reading a TypeScript error and wondering: "Why won't it just leave me alone?"

In this talk, I'll explain why the compiler sometimes seems spiteful. We'll discuss the type system's power, limitations, and historical reasoning behind its design choices. I hope you leave the talk with a better understanding of TypeScript and more compassion for your loyal friend, the compiler.
