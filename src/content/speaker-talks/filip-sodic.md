title: "Treat the Compiler With Compassion"
---

The compiler is your friend.

Even when you think it's out to get you, chances are it's just misunderstood. Before exploring TypeScript's inner workings, I used to spend more time than I care to admit cluelessly reading an error and wondering: "Why won't it just leave me alone?"

In this talk, I'll explain why the compiler sometimes seems spiteful. We'll discuss the type system's power, its limitations, and the historical reasons behind its design.

By sharing some insights from TypeScript's deep end, I hope to leave you with a better understanding of the language and more compassion for your loyal friend, the compiler.
