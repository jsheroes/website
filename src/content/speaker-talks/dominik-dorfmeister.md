title: "Dead Code Shouldn't Exist: How We Removed 28k Lines of Code, One Knip at a Time"
---

Ever wonder how much of your codebase is justâ€¦ hanging around, doing nothing? At Sentry, we did too - and the answer was more than we expected. In this talk, I'll share how we used Knip, a powerful tool for detecting unused files, exports, and dependencies, to declutter our frontend codebase. You'll learn about the practical steps we took to safely identify and remove dead code, how we integrated Knip into our workflows, about unexpected edge-cases and what we learned along the way. Whether you're maintaining a massive monolith or just looking to tidy up, this session will give you practical strategies - and maybe a little inspiration - to start decluttering your own codebase, one Knip at a time.
