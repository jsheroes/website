title: "Type-Safe Style Systems: The Future of CSS"
---

Most CSS developers today write visual styles in terms of what you literally see: exact color values, size numbers, and so on. But what if you could write styles as a function of how they fit into your design system? And what if you could get type safety in specifying and using those values, including in responsive props?

This talk will dive into some of the key features and flaws in many design system builders today such as Chakra UI and Tailwind. We'll establish what the best next steps for design systems should be with type-safe TypeScript APIs and performance both for prebuilt pages and at runtime. The Vanilla Extract and Rainbow Sprinkles projects together are a great way to try this out now, and I'm hopeful for more efforts.

Attendees will leave the talk both with an appreciation for the systems of today and hope for the type-safe systems of the future.
