title: Tooling Like It's 2025
---

TypeScript! ESLint! Biome! Oh my! So many tools exist that we can choose from as modern developers. Do you ever feel like you're getting lost in a sea of GitHub README.mds and configuration file messes?

Let's talk about the state of tooling for TypeScript developers in 2025. What are the tools that many developers are finding helpful? How are those tools changing over time to be more helpful (and less annoying to configure)? Why do we even care about tooling when we have TypeScript!?

All those questions and more will be answered. We'll cover:

- The state of common tooling: linters, TypeScript, their integrations together (hello, Rust!)
- Some of the great benefits of aggressive static analysis (hello, plugins!)
- Miscellaneous other tools such as Knip and TypeChat (hello, AI!)
- High-level trends for tooling

After this talk, you'll be prepared not just to configure your linter and type checker, but you'll understand why so many developers are excited for that task in the first place.
