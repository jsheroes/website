title: Reimagining web layout for accessible multilingual content
---

Web layout is one of the most important aspects of web development, as it determines how the content is presented and perceived by the users. However, web layout is not a one-size-fits-all solution, as different languages and writing modes have different text directions and layout conventions. Using traditional CSS properties can lead to layout issues when the text direction changes.

To solve this problem, we can use CSS logical properties. In this presentation, we will explore CSS logical properties and how they differ from traditional CSS properties. We will see some practical examples of using CSS logical properties in real-world scenarios, that you can apply in your next project.
