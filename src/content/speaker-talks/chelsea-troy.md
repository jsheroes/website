How can we expect LLM products to impact software engineering? Join Chelsea Troy for an examination of how LLM products are built, what they tend to do well with, and where they tend to struggle. Then, take a tour with Chelsea through current research elucidating the impact of LLM use on developer productivity, and dig into what that means for us as practitioners in an LLM-enabled world.
