title: Designing APIs for Complex Libraries
---

When you build a library that is POWERFUL - can handle use cases in lots of different circumstances - you face a challenge with making that library's API DISCOVERABLE. Git is a fantastic example of this: it's a powerful version control library that can solve a LOT of problems for programmers, except that most programmers don't know 80% of what it does. This isn't a deficiency in programmers: the library just has a high power to discoverability ratio. For your library to REACH all the use cases it can solve for, your team has to have a discoverability strategy. Join Chelsea to learn about success metrics and implementation options for such a strategy.
