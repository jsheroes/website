How do you get into the zone while coding? Why does taking a walk or taking a shower seem to help solve problems?

Everything we do is regulated by complex processes in the brain, and coding is no exception. Sometimes it can feel difficult to feel in control of our brains when coding, but to debug the problem weâ€™ll first need to understand it.

This talk will dive into the basic neurological processes and psychological behaviors involved with learning and writing code. By understanding the physiological processes involved in the work we do, we can be more in touch with our bodies and more productive as a result.
