A week ago, my team and I embarked on a journey to the heart of Transylvania – **Cluj, Romania**, to participate in the **JSHeroes 2024** conference. As expected, it's a web conference tailored specifically for front-end developers.

**JSHeroes** exceeded our expectations in every way. Beyond the impressive talks, the organization's meticulous planning truly set it apart from other conferences we've attended. At a cost of 150 euros, attendees receive far more than anticipated – meals, snacks, and even ice cream, highlighting excellent value and the content was phenomenal and interesting!

## Why go to a web conference?

Attending a conference like JSHeroes feels like stumbling upon a hidden treasure. It's not just about the latest tools or frameworks; it's about connecting with folks who share your passion for front-end development. That energy, that buzz, it's super motivating.

Conferences are like the tech equivalent of a music festival, minus the camping and questionable hygiene levels. Plus, getting out of your comfort zone and exploring new cities doesn't hurt either. You should connect with interesting people and speakers you admire. Who knows what can come out of a Linkedin connection? New job? New project? Collaboration? You don't know unless you try.

### Networking

At the heart of any conference lies the power of networking. Conferences bring together professionals from various backgrounds and industries, creating a fertile ground for exchanging ideas, sharing experiences, and forging long-lasting connections. Whether you're looking to collaborate on a project, seek advice from seasoned veterans, or simply expand your professional network, conferences offer countless opportunities to meet and interact with like-minded individuals.

So, in order to connect with speakers I admired, what did I do? Well, I approached them in the right time (not when they are talking on the stage!) when they are free and tell them what you think of the talk, ask them questions and ask if they want to connect on social media. I've never had a bad experience when I engaged in a conversation with a speaker (in any conference that I've been to).

If you're shy or you simply didn't have an opportunity to reach out to your favorite speaker during the conference, find them online on LinkedIn, Instagram, or whichever platform they're on and just say hi. I guarantee that the worst thing that could happen is them not responding because they are either super busy or they haven't seen the message (yet), but in most cases they will be glad that you reach out to them. They also want to connect with other people, trust me.

### Learning from the best

Another key benefit of attending a conference like **JSHeroes** is the chance to learn from the best in the industry. The conference features talks and workshops delivered by renowned experts who are not only knowledgeable but also passionate about their work. Their insights can spark new ideas, challenge your current beliefs, and equip you with cutting-edge skills that can immediately impact your projects. Whether you're a beginner looking to grasp the fundamentals or an experienced developer seeking to deepen your expertise, JSHeroes caters to a wide range of learning needs.

Our exposure to [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) through a talk by [Debbie O'Brien](https://x.com/debs_obrien), Senior Program Manager at Microsoft, last year significantly influenced our decision to adopt it for our end-to-end testing. Such practical insights underscore the value of conferences in shaping both personal and professional development.

### Boosting your motivation

Conferences can be a significant boost to your motivation. Being surrounded by individuals who are equally passionate about technology can reignite your enthusiasm for your work. The energy and positivity at such events can inspire you to push boundaries, experiment with new concepts, and approach challenges with renewed vigor. This motivational surge can carry over into your daily life and projects, driving you to achieve greater things.

### Exploring new cities

Venturing to a new city for a conference like JSHeroes adds an extra dimension of excitement and discovery. It's not just about the conference itself; it's about immersing yourself in a different culture, trying local cuisines, and experiencing the unique atmosphere of the host city. This aspect of attending JSHeroes encourages stepping out of your comfort zone, fostering creativity and openness to new ideas.

### Tips

Take notes during talks! I personally had my laptop with me and opened up notes, and started taking down whatever I thought was interesting to me. I paid extra attention to website links of the speakers so I could check them out later.
