summary: Hi! I'm Alex and this blog post is about my experience at JS Heroes 2023.

After a couple of years without in-person conferences, I was really glad to return to JSHeroes for a 2-day event. So I'm gonna use this blog post to share my experience with you.

I have to start with the MC - Anjana Vakil - which I think was a perfect fit for the role. She was so full of energy and enthusiasm that she really got us pumped for the conference. I'm embedding the after movie - starting at second 22 - so you can see her contagious energy for yourself!

Moving on to the technical side, the conference had a big diversity in the topics covered. Things like CSS, performance, accessibility, realtime apps, state management and AI-powered experiences were just a few of the subjects talked about.

I think any developer, no matter the experience, found something useful among the talks. I went with 2 friends which are just starting their JavaScript journey and both left with some extra knowledge and excited about becoming developers.

My favorite 3 talks were:

1. [Building AI-powered user interfaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQjubOMOWzo&list=PLB9NqTp0uKrR8g9ImDK2HPcpuC7oW8wYe&index=11) by Jani Ev√§kallio

2. [Leveraging (algebraic data) types to make your UI rock solid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrLPvAOjJxM&list=PLB9NqTp0uKrR8g9ImDK2HPcpuC7oW8wYe&index=15) by Matthias Le Brun

3. [We're All Doing the Best We Can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtgrsmaKzDg&list=PLB9NqTp0uKrR8g9ImDK2HPcpuC7oW8wYe&index=7) by Jeffrey Lembeck

I'm not gonna get into each specific one, but I encourage you to check them out on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6qr6L37sl8&list=PLB9NqTp0uKrR8g9ImDK2HPcpuC7oW8wYe).


During the breaks, there was an alternative stage where together with the speakers we would have some casual discussions on the topics. There was a really nice debate about AI and the future of programming now that we have tools like Copilot and ChatGPT. I wish that was recorded...

Oh, and did I mention the conference is non-profit and open-source? They had a "souvenir booth" where all the proceeds went to a local bears sanctuary. And they do publish they expenses report each year. That's pretty nice!

Looking back, the only thing I regret is not participating in the after-conference activities, but I promise I'll be there next year.

See you in 2024!
