During the last 6 years, JSHeroes became one of the biggest software development conferences in South-East Europe, and is one of the most popular tech events in Romania. For this year, although the pandemics are not long gone, we decided to pluck up our hearts and organize an offline event, even if it needs to be on a smaller scale.

For the 4th edition, we decided to go for a 1-day event, with only 300 participants, so that everyone feels safe to join. The event will take place at Grand Hotel Italia, in Cluj-Napoca, and it is organized by JSHeroes, one of the most active JavaScript communities in Europe. We strongly believe that the community model is the best environment for learning, so we are publishing all the data about this conference each year, in full transparency, to make it easier for other communities to build on our knowledge and organize even better events.

As you are already used to from our past Transparency reports, this is the part where we are going to talk about money. The estimated budget for the 1-day conference is 35.500 EUR. Why?

The expenses presented below could shed some light on what organizing a conference means in terms of costs (but not only):

Summary:

- Cost — 35.500 EUR
- Profit — 0
- Attendees — 300
- Days — 1
- Speakers — 13

Estimated expenses:

- Staff — 0 EUR (our team of 14 people is working in their spare time to bring to life an event that once was just a dream)
- Speakers (flight tickets, accommodation, leisure trip, gift bags, going out) — 12.6 K EUR
- Venue + food & drinks (3 coffee breaks + 1 lunch for every attendee) — 9.3K EUR
- Photo-video services — 2.4K EUR
- Swag (stickers, badges), Promotional stuff (giveaways) — 2.2K EUR
- Promotional campaigns — 500 EUR
- Accounting services — 2.3K EUR
- Other services that cannot be covered by volunteers (e.g.: design, sketching during the conference) — 2K EUR
- Tools subscriptions (hosting) — 250 EUR
- Venue services & design (Barista, Photobooth) — 2K EUR
- Fees (Ti.to, PayPal, Bank) — 1K EUR
- Discounts for other communities, free Diversity tickets, Blood campaign donation — 1K EUR

How do we plan to pay for all these things?

- Tickets — after estimating the costs, we calculate the tickets’ price, so as to cover the conference price, but to keep our non-profit scope. We assumed that we will have sold 240 tickets: 100 Early Bird tickets _ 90 EUR+VAT, and 140 Regular tickets _ 125 EUR + VAT — Total: 26.5K EUR
- Sponsors — whose only interest is to help the community grow by paying a fee for a special sponsorship package, recruitment-free, with only a few benefits, as our purpose is not to get any kind of profit out of this, but to get some help in organizing a great event) \* 2.000 EUR/sponsorship package. So we need to have at least 5 sponsors to cover the basic costs.

If this year’s budget will look as good as the one for the previous edition’s in the end, with the extra money we want to continue the plans we made for helping the growth of a connected global community as follows:

- Offer more tickets for our Diversity Tickets initiative
- Offer Live captions for JSHeroes 2023 event
- Scale up our event back to a 2 days, 700 attendees event.

We are looking forward to seeing how this edition unfolds and plan to be back with news on the real budget soon after. If you are curious about other details or think there is anything we can help with, drop us a line, we would be glad to support you.
