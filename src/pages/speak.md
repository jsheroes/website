The <strong>call for papers</strong> for the 2025 event is <strong>closed</strong>.

We have received <strong>269 proposals</strong> until the end of December 2024. Speakers will be announced sometime in early February.

<!-- We encourage people of all ages, races, genders and religions, to send their proposals until the end of December 2024. We would like to ensure everyone that our process of selecting the talks will be <strong>fair</strong> and <strong>transparent</strong>, as the entire concept behind JSHeroes.

Before sending a proposal, it might be worth reading [this article](/blog/how-to-write-a-good-talk-proposal) about what makes a CFP proposal good.

## ‚úç What we are looking for

JSHeroes is a **single track** 2-day conference dedicated to the JS and Web ecosystems. We expect each talk to be around **25 minutes**. If you require more time, please mention this in the application. We are looking for a multitude of topics and perspectives, but most of all we value:

- Original topics, presented for the first time.
- Practical ideas that attendees can apply at work the next day.
- Trends and hot topics which are relevant today and beyond.
- Fresh perspectives on the development ecosystem.
- The human side of software engineering.

In 2025 we want to **bridge the gap** between the industry problems and the solutions put forward by the tech community. We are looking for talks about common architecture problems, talks that highlight the struggles of managing complexity, maintainability and scalability and talks that explore new technologies, frameworks and standards. Each year our theme is broad and not all talks will be connected with it, so consider it more like a line connecting different ideas and topics, rather than a restriction.

## üìà How the selection will happen

You can read more about [our 2023 CFP process](/blog/call-for-papers-2023-insights) to have a better idea about how we select our speakers.

Each year we receive hundreds of proposals from which we can unfortunately only pick a handful. With this in mind, we created a team of world wide subject matter experts that will go through the proposals and will decide what to include on the final agenda. This is a rough estimation of our schedule and process:

- Each member of the commitee will go through the **anonymized** proposals and rate them.
- All proposals that are above a threshold qualify to the **second stage**.
- In the second stage we de-anonymize the remaining proposals and start **head-to-head comparisons** on the similar topics.
- One by one, we will fill in the slots in our agenda, based on the topics we feel can bring the **most value** to our audience.
- All the speakers will get **a response**, positive or negative, at the end of the process.

## üèÜ The perks we offer

If your proposal gets selected, we will make sure you have the best possible experience for your entire stay in Cluj. Here are some of the benefits we offer to all our speakers:

- Full payment for your **travel** to and from the event
- **4 nights** at a 5 star hotel, right on top of the venue
- Free entrance at the conference for both days
- **Extra ticket** + double room option, in case somebody is joining you
- **Speakers trip** on the day after the event
- Speaker dinners and other activities around the event

## ‚úã Help and support along the way

We are committed to fulfilling our mission as an open source event. We are all community people and we want to be as close to you as possible. We will try to be supportive and helpful and we will do our best to get back to you with valuable feedback from the CFP process. In case you wish to talk with someone from the team, do not hesitate to [get in touch over email](mailto:welcome@jsheroes.io).

Good luck!
