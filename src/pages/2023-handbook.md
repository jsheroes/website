## Date and Venue 📆 🌎

JSHeroes2023 will take place on <b>May 18-19th</b> (Thursday & Friday) at <b>Grand Hotel Italia</b> in Cluj-Napoca. It is a one-track conference and we have reserved the space from the hotel's ground floor, a spacious conference room and a large lobby, where you can enjoy the talks, the technical booths and the networking area.

Also, during the coffee and lunch breaks, we will have multiple small stages, in some parts of the hallway, where everyone will be able to join, as a speaker or participant. We want to encourage open discussions, open-source projects presentations, lightning talks, and anything which is remotely related to what we do and our mission and values.


## Agenda and Theme 📒✨

This year we want to shift our attention to the decade of progress in the world of web development. Back in 2013, we went through a period of rethinking practices as frontend development took off and became one of the most crucial disciplines in tech. Frameworks like: React, Angular or Vue, and their ecosystems now enter into their second decade of existence, while web capabilities and standards are increasingly more potent and versatile.

<b>So in 2023, let’s celebrate the past 10 years, reflecting on the evolution of our tools and patterns, with the good and the bad that comes with this rapid evolution.</b>

Check out the agenda [here](https://jsheroes.io/#agenda). We’ll post all the talks, soon after the conference, on our [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeJEpnvZhG-VwGpzrzYLidQ) channel. During the conference, we’re not going to live stream though.

## Communication 📢 
[Join our slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/js-heroes/shared_invite/zt-7dyi0itf-V~8Z7BUJpFm9ymgHjUwf7A) for quickly communicating with the organizers and speakers during the event. We will also communicate news/updates about the event on Slack before and also after the event.

## Catering 🍎

There is a premium catering lunch and coffee breaks. We definitely don't want you to run around all hungry and decaffeinated throughout the day, so the lunch and coffee breaks are included in the ticket price. For lunch, you can expect a healthy meal with various options. It includes vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options.

## Accessibility ♿  

We are trying our best to make JSHeroes hassle-free for everyone. The venue is a 5-star hotel that is fully wheelchair accessible and all the activities are held on the ground floor. 

Additionally, we will hand a set of accessibility guidelines to all our speakers to ensure that their talks and slide decks are inclusive in language and content.
