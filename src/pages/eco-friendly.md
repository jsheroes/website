As a person who is interested in ecology, we would like to inform you that this year’s conference in Cluj Napoca has been organized with sustainability in mind. We understand the importance of reducing our carbon footprint and promoting eco-friendly initiatives, which is why we have continued our efforts for 2024.

### The venue

We are going to organise the conference at the same **venue** and we are happy to say that it uses LED lighting and it is easily accessible for our attendees via public transportation. The closest bus station is located just 100 meters away and buses run frequently from the city center, making transportation to and from the conference a breeze.

### Food catering

When it comes to **catering**, we wanted to offer a variety of options that go with different dietary needs while also promoting sustainability and **food waste**. We have included vegetarian and vegan options, and, in addition, the venue makes a commitment to donate any leftover food to local charities or people in need.

### Waste management

Same as previous editions, we are committed to effective waste management during the conference, thus you will find **labeled bins** for recycling available throughout the venue.

We will continue having a special bin for recycling **plastic caps**. The money collected from the caps will be donated to charity through _[Capace pentru suflete](https://www.capacecusuflet.ro/)_, a local organisation.

We are also very excited about our initiative that encourages participants to return their **badges and lanyards** in separate bins at the end of the event.

### Coffee and water

We know coffee is important for our participants, so we continue to take great care in improving this aspect when it comes to waste management. We will continue using **100% biodegradable** cups, but, most importantly we would like to encourage you to join us in making this conference as sustainable as possible, by *bringing your own reusable coffee cup*.

When it comes to water, we are thrilled to announce that we’ve totally reduced our plastic use. We will have two **water coolers** and glass bottles ready and waiting for you. And, most importantly, we encourage you to *bring your own water recipient*. 

### Merchandise point

When it comes to our **merchandise point**, we will offer eco-friendly swag options, such as reusable tote bags made by people with disabilities from <a href="https://atelieruldepanza.ro/">atelierul de panza</a>, water bottles from ORIGAMI, socks made by a local producer, and t-shirts made from 100% organic cotton.

### Reducing paper use

Every year we try to **minimize printing on paper** as much as possible. We send all useful information to participants about the conference through our newsletter, and this year we have prepared a Conference Handbook for you, where you can find any information you need. Plus, there is no need to bring a printed ticket; simply show it to us on your phone.

### Supporting Agent Green

In addition to these initiatives, and because our mascot, [Ecma](https://jsheroes.io/meet-ecma), is a bear, we will encourage our participants to make a donation to the [Agent Green](https://www.agentgreen.ro/) organisation. They are heavily involved in concrete actions when it comes to saving Romanian forests and protecting the brown bear. They continue to fight and win processes regarding illegal deforestation. 

All this being said, we believe that it is important to come together as a community to address part of the problems facing our environment. By taking action and focusing on sustainable practices, we can create a positive impact. We look forward to seeing you at the conference where we can collaborate and share more ideas on how we can improve.
