We are thrilled to announce that this year's conference in Cluj Napoca has been organized with sustainability in mind. We understand the importance of reducing our carbon footprint and promoting eco-friendly initiatives in the industry, which is why we have started to implement a few green initiatives to make this conference as sustainable as possible. 

### The venue

We are going to organise the conference at the same **venue** and we are happy to say that it uses LED lighting and it is easily accessible for our attendees via public transportation. The closest bus station is located just 100 meters away and buses run frequently from the city center, making transportation to and from the conference a breeze.

### Food catering

When it comes to **catering**, we wanted to offer a variety of options that go with different dietary needs while also promoting sustainability and **food waste**. We have included vegetarian and vegan options, and, in addition, the venue makes a commitment to donate any leftover food to local charities or people in need. 

### Waste management

This year, we are committed to effective waste management throughout the conference. You will find **labeled bins** for recycling available throughout the venue, along with clear and easily understandable signage to help you properly dispose your waste.

This will be the first year when we will prepare a special bin for **recycling plastic caps**. The money collected from the cups will be donated to charity through *[Capace pentru suflete](https://www.capacecusuflet.ro/)*, a local organisation.

We are also very excited about initiative that encourages participants to return their **badges and lanyards** in separate bins at the end of the event. As an added incentive, we will be holding a random raffle to select one winner for a ticket to next year's conference.

### Coffee and water

We know coffee is important for our participants, so we took great care in improving this aspect as well. This will be the first year when we will use **100% biodegradable cups**, but, most importantly we would like to encourage you to join us in making this conference as sustainable as possible, by bringing your *own reusable coffee cups*. 

We're taking our **water** game to the next level this year. No more plastic bottles for participants. We have two water coolers ready and waiting for you. And, most importantly, we encourage you to bring your own water bottle. Common actions can help reduce waste.

### Merchandise point

When it comes to our **merchandise point**, we will offer eco-friendly swag options, such as reusable tote bags made by people with disabilities from <a href="https://atelieruldepanza.ro/">atelierul de panza</a>, water bottles from ORIGAMI, socks made by a local producer, and t-shirts made from 100% organic cotton.

### Reducing paper use

In-person events have traditionally relied on paper and disposable forms of communication, such as print banners, signs, and brochures. However, every year we try to **minimize printing on paper** as much as possible. We send all useful information to participants about the conference through our newsletter, and this year we have prepared a Conference Handbook for you, where you can find any information you need. Plus, there is no need to bring a printed ticket; simply show it to us on your phone.

### Supporting Zarnesti Bear Sanctuary

In addition to these initiatives, and because our mascot, [Ecma](https://website-git-eco-friendly-page-jsheroes.vercel.app/meet-ecma), is a bear, we will once again encourage our participants to make a donation to the Zarnesti Bear Sanctuary. This sanctuary, one of the largest in Eastern Europe, is dedicated to the welfare of bears. 

We believe that it is important to come together as a community to address the pressing issues facing our environment. By taking action and implementing sustainable practices, we can create a positive impact. We hope to inspire and motivate individuals and organizations to join us in this effort, as we work towards a better and more sustainable future for all. We look forward to seeing you at the conference where we can collaborate and share more ideas on how we can improve.
