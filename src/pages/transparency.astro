      <h1>Transparency Report</h1>
      <p>
        Since we started doing JSHeroes in 2017, our goal was to open source our
        way of doing events, from the processes behind speaker selection, to the
        budges and costs associated with each event.
      </p>
      <p>
        We strongly believe that open model is the best environment for
        learning, so we’re publishing all the data about this conference, in
        full transparency, to make it easier for other communities to build on
        our knowledge and organize even better events.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until 2024, we published blog posts before and after each event, with <a
          href="/tags/plans">the budget planning</a
        > and <a href="/tags/reports">the expenses report</a>. But we decided to
        build this page to make it easier to visualize things over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
        All figures below are in euros(€). Different contexts over the years
        mean the amounts can differ significantly. For example, the first
        edition in 2017 had around 350 attendees, while the 2019 one had close
        to 700. Also as an anomaly, the 2022 edition was a single day event, so
        costs are roughly half of what they'd normally been for a 2 days event.

          First, have a look at how our budget and expenses evolved over the

      <h2>Giving back</h2>
      <p>
        Each event so far had good budget planning, and we managed our expenses
        so that we are left with a money supply that helps us kick-start the
        next edition. We were fortunate to have this reserve in 2020 when that
        year's edition was cancelled due to the outbreak of COVID-19.
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting from 2022, we pay each speaker a €500 fee. This does not appear
        in our budget as it is paid from this reserve at the end of each
        edition. Some of the speakers do not accept a fee, so we donate the
        money to different initiatives:
