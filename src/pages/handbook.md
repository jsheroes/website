## üìÜ üåé Date and Venue

JSHeroes 2025 will take place on <b>May 29-30th</b> (Thursday & Friday) at <b>[Grand Hotel Italia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Grand+Hotel+Italia)</b> in Cluj-Napoca. It is a one-track conference and we have reserved the space from the hotel's ground floor, a spacious conference room, and a large lobby, where you can enjoy the talks, the technical booths, and the networking area.

Also, during the coffee and lunch breaks, we will have an alternative stage, with interesting conversations and follow-ups from the talks on the main stage. Everyone will be able to join, as a speaker or participant. We also want to encourage open discussions, projects presentations, lightning talks, and anything which is remotely related to what we do and our mission and values.

Bellow you can find a map of the entire venue, with all the points of interest marked accordingly.

## üìí‚ú® Agenda and Theme

Our speakers will present solutions for common industry problems, highlight the struggles with managing complexity, maintainability and scalability and will explore new technologies, frameworks and standards that tackle all these concerns.

## üé§ Pre-event meetup

On the evening before the event, May 28th, you can [join the pre-event meetup](https://www.meetup.com/women-in-tech-cluj/events/307912304) organized by Women in Tech Cluj. Three of our speakers will be part of a very exciting panel discussion about technical debt and refactoring.

## üìç City tour

Are you coming to Cluj for the first time? Or maybe you've been here before (or you even live here) but you don't know much about its history? We're organizing a two-hour free walking tour with a professional local guide.

We post all the major updates on our [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/jsheroes-community), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jsheroes.io) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jsheroes) pages.

We encourage you to use the hashtag **#JSHeroes** to tweet and post about the conference, connect with other attendees, and share your photos when the big days arrive.

## üöå Transportation

You can conveniently reach the event location by bus, as **line 21** stops a few hundred meters away from the venue.

Please keep in mind that the hotel parking area is not free of charge. Additionally, _heavy traffic_ is to be expected in the area during morning rush hour, so plan accordingly and allow extra time for travel. We hope you have a safe and smooth journey to the conference.

## ‚ôø Accessibility

We are trying our best to make JSHeroes hassle-free for everyone. The venue is a 5-star hotel that is fully wheelchair accessible and all the activities are held on the ground floor.

Additionally, we will hand a set of accessibility guidelines to all our speakers to ensure that their talks and slide decks are inclusive in language and content.

We have two dedicated rooms at the first floor of the hotel: a kids room and a focus room. There's a [dedicated page for accessibility and inclusion](/accessibility) at JSHeroes we invite you to read to find out more about.

## üå± Eco-friendly

We are thrilled to announce that this year's event has been organized with sustainability in mind and with the desire to limit its environment impact.

We understand the importance of reducing our carbon footprint and promoting [eco-friendly initiatives](/eco-friendly) in the industry, which is why we have started to implement a few green initiatives to make this conference as sustainable as possible.

## üé§ Alternative stage

In keeping with our tradition from previous years, the alternative stage will once again be a central part of our event. This informal area serves as a meeting point for speakers and attendees to participate in casual discussions or spontaneous presentations during coffee and lunch breaks. Andrei Antal will return as the host for the stage and our MCs will share the upcoming discussions at the alternative stage before each break.

## üçé Catering

There is a premium catering lunch and coffee breaks. We don't want you to run around all hungry and decaffeinated throughout the day, so the lunch and coffee breaks are included in the ticket price. For lunch, you can expect a healthy meal with various options. It includes **vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options**.

## üì∏ Photos

Throughout the conference, we'll take photos and video shots. Your participation at the event represents your consent to share the materials on social media. If you don't want to appear in photos, you can choose a **white lanyard** at the registration and we'll take care to filter the materials that will be shared online.

## ü§ù Code of Conduct

All attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at the JSHeroes event are required to agree with our [Code of Conduct](/coc). As organizers, JSHeroes will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all of you to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.
