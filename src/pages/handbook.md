## üìÜ üåé Date and Venue

JSHeroes 2024 will take place on <b>May 23-24th</b> (Thursday & Friday) at <b>[Grand Hotel Italia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Grand+Hotel+Italia)</b> in Cluj-Napoca. It is a one-track conference and we have reserved the space from the hotel's ground floor, a spacious conference room, and a large lobby, where you can enjoy the talks, the technical booths, and the networking area.

Also, during the coffee and lunch breaks, we will have multiple small stages, in some parts of the hallway, where everyone will be able to join, as a speaker or participant. We want to encourage open discussions, open-source projects presentations, lightning talks, and anything which is remotely related to what we do and our mission and values.

## üìí‚ú® Agenda and Theme

After we reflected in 2023 on the past 10 years of frontend development, in 2024 we want to spotlight some of the established patterns and architectures that reached maturity and are becoming industry standards.

Leaving behind us the tumultuous growth of the JS ecosystem we will focus on the positive outcomes of all the years of challenging ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù. We want to bring on stage talks about design patterns and system architecture, but also web standards and language advancements. Along with these, we want to tackle software complexity and dealing with legacy code and legacy systems.

At JSHeroes, we always ventured outside the pure language ecosystem, so expect to see a variety of talks covering the entire landscape of web development and JavaScript as a universal programming language.

But of course, we will not neglect the human side of things, in our effort to paint a full picture for the development community in 2024.

Check out the agenda [here](https://jsheroes.io/#agenda). We‚Äôll post all the talks, soon after the conference, on our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeJEpnvZhG-VwGpzrzYLidQ) channel. During the conference, we‚Äôre not going to live stream though.

Additionally, we will hand a set of accessibility guidelines to all our speakers to ensure that their talks and slide decks are inclusive in language and content.

We have two dedicated rooms at the first floor of the hotel: a kids room and a focus room. There's a [dedicated page for accessibility and inclusion](/accessibility) at JSHeroes we invite you to read to find out more about.

## üå± Eco-friendly

We are thrilled to announce that this year's event has been organized with sustainability in mind and with the desire to limit its environment impact.

We understand the importance of reducing our carbon footprint and promoting [eco-friendly initiatives](/eco-friendly) in the industry, which is why we have started to implement a few green initiatives to make this conference as sustainable as possible.

## üé§ Alternative stage

In keeping with our tradition from previous years, the alternative stage will once again be a central part of our event. This informal area, nestled in a corner of the event hall, serves as a meeting point for speakers and attendees to participate in casual discussions or spontaneous presentations during coffee and lunch breaks. Andrei Antal will return as the host of the stage, with our MC sharing the details of the discussions before each break.
