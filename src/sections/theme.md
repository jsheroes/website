<h2 id="agenda">Bridging the gap</h2>

Our ecosystem has an abundance of technologies, tools, frameworks and services to deliver applications faster than ever before. With new standards and ways of building across multiple platforms, developers have wide toolkit at their disposal. But there's a growing gap between our projects, with accumulated technical debt and complexity, and the tools and frameworks developed by the community. In 2025, we're bridging that gap.

Our speakers will present solutions for common industry problems, highlight the strugles with managing complexity, maintainability and scalability and will explore new technologies, frameworks and standards that tackle all these concerns.

At JSHeroes, we always ventured outside the pure language ecosystem, so expect to see a variety of talks covering the entire landscape of web development and JavaScript as a universal programming language.

But of course, we will not neglect the human side of things, in our effort to paint a full picture for the development community in 2025.
