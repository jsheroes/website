<h2 id="agenda">Looking into the future ðŸš€</h2>

In 2026, we will explore the latest trends in engineering and architecture and the tools and frameworks that will shape our work in the years to come. Our speakers will share their insights on the technologies and practices that can help us navigate through constant changes and growing complexities. They will also emphasize the skills and competencies that are essential for our professional growth.

At JSHeroes, we always ventured outside the language ecosystem, so expect to see a variety of talks covering the entire landscape of web development and JavaScript as a universal programming language. But of course, we will not neglect the human side of things, in our effort to paint a full picture for the development community in 2026.
