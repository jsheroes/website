<h2 id="agenda">Looking into the future 🔮</h2>

In 2026, we will explore the latest **trends** in engineering and architecture and the **tools** and **frameworks** that will shape our work in the years to come. Our speakers will share their insights on the **technologies** and **practices** that can help us navigate through constant changes and growing complexities. They will also emphasize the **skills** and **competencies** that are essential for our professional growth.

At JSHeroes, we always ventured outside the language ecosystem, so expect to see a variety of talks covering the entire landscape of web development and JavaScript as a universal programming language. But of course, we will not neglect the human side of things, in our effort to paint a full picture for the development community in 2026.
