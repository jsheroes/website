## An open-source community event

JSHeroes is a non-profit community-organized conference, held every year in Cluj, Romania. Our goal is to bring together JS and Web/Frontend development enthusiasts from all over the world for a two day event with: great talks, amazing networking and tons of fun. You bring your ideas and desire to learn, we provide the relaxed atmosphere and the good vibes.

We believe that the **community** and the **open-source** models are well suited for our core values: learning, teaching and knowledge sharing. Our mission is to inspire other communities with the concept of open-source events.

We're publishing all data about this conference, in [full transparency](/blog/2022-transparency-report). We are also available at any time for inquires and we're really looking forward to sharing our knowledge about organizing international events. This way, whenever a community wants to start something similar, they can build on our knowledge.
