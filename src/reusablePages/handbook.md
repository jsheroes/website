## üìÜ üåé Date and Venue

JSHeroes 2023 will take place on <b>May 18-19th</b> (Thursday & Friday) at <b>[Grand Hotel Italia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Grand+Hotel+Italia)</b> in Cluj-Napoca. It is a one-track conference and we have reserved the space from the hotel's ground floor, a spacious conference room, and a large lobby, where you can enjoy the talks, the technical booths, and the networking area.

Also, during the coffee and lunch breaks, we will have multiple small stages, in some parts of the hallway, where everyone will be able to join, as a speaker or participant. We want to encourage open discussions, open-source projects presentations, lightning talks, and anything which is remotely related to what we do and our mission and values.

## üìí‚ú® Agenda and Theme

This year we want to shift our attention to the decade of progress in the world of web development. Back in 2013, we went through a period of rethinking practices as front-end development took off and became one of the most crucial disciplines in tech. Frameworks like: React, Angular, or Vue, and their ecosystems now enter into their second decade of existence, while web capabilities and standards are increasingly more potent and versatile.

<b>So in 2023, let‚Äôs celebrate the past 10 years, reflecting on the evolution of our tools and patterns, with the good and the bad that comes with this rapid evolution.</b>

Check out the agenda [here](https://jsheroes.io/#agenda). We‚Äôll post all the talks, soon after the conference, on our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeJEpnvZhG-VwGpzrzYLidQ) channel. During the conference, we‚Äôre not going to live stream though.

## üé§ Pre-event meetup

The evening before the event, on the 17th of May, we organize the traditional pre-event meetup. This year, we're partnering up with Women in Tech Cluj and we're going to have a panel discussion with three of our conference guests from 2023. Registration is available via [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/jsheroes/events/293342798/).

## üìç City tour

Are you coming to Cluj for the first time? Or maybe you've been here before (or you even live here) but you don't know much about its history? We're organizing a two-hour free walking tour with a professional local guide.

If you are interested, please register via [this quick form](https://forms.gle/3N8sZTBcrkiBv2CB7) so we are better prepared for the size of the group.

## üé´ Tickets

Please make sure you have your name registered and that your ticket info is correct. You can also easily change your ticket details by accessing them directly from your email. **No need to print anything**, we'll have your badge ready at the registration desk.

## üì¢ Communication

[Join our slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/js-heroes/shared_invite/zt-7dyi0itf-V~8Z7BUJpFm9ymgHjUwf7A) for quickly communicating with the organizers and speakers during the event. We will also communicate news/updates about the event on Slack before and also after the event.

We post all the major updates on our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/jsheroes/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jsheroes) pages. So you can follow and join us on both.

We encourage you to use the hashtag **#JSHeroes2023** to tweet and post about the conference, connect with other attendees, and share your photos when the big days arrive.

## üöå Transportation

You can conveniently reach the event location by bus, as **line 21** stops a few hundred meters away from the venue.

Please keep in mind that the dedicated parking area at the hotel is not free anymore. Additionally, _heavy traffic_ is to be expected in the area during morning rush hour, so plan accordingly and allow extra time for travel. We hope you have a safe and smooth journey to the conference.

## ‚ôø Accessibility

We are trying our best to make JSHeroes hassle-free for everyone. The venue is a 5-star hotel that is fully wheelchair accessible and all the activities are held on the ground floor.

Additionally, we will hand a set of accessibility guidelines to all our speakers to ensure that their talks and slide decks are inclusive in language and content.

We have two dedicated rooms at the first floor of the hotel: a kids room and a focus room. There's a [dedicated page for accessibility and inclusion](/accessibility) at JSHeroes we invite you to read to find out more about.

## üå± Eco-friendly

We are thrilled to announce that this year's event has been organized with sustainability in mind and with the desire to limit its environment impact.

We understand the importance of reducing our carbon footprint and promoting [eco-friendly initiatives](/eco-friendly) in the industry, which is why we have started to implement a few green initiatives to make this conference as sustainable as possible.

## üé§ Alternative stage

We‚Äôre bringing back the concept of the alternative stage, a laid-back area in a corner of the event hall where speakers and attendees gather in the coffee breaks and during the lunch break for informal discussions or on the spot presentations. The stage is hosted by Andrei Antal and the details about the discussions will be announced before the breaks by our MC.

## üßò Pilates session

As a novelty for 2023, we're introducing a pilates session in the morning of the second day of the event. The session will be held in a separate room and will be driven by one of our close friends, Carmen Popoviciu, who is also a certified pilates trainer. She will showcase different types of exercises for improving our posture or dealing with pains specific to intense office work.

If you wish to attend, please [register via this form](https://forms.gle/5Cm7HZhLVAyyxRzm7) so we know how to better prepare for the session.

## üçé Catering

There is a premium catering lunch and coffee breaks. We don't want you to run around all hungry and decaffeinated throughout the day, so the lunch and coffee breaks are included in the ticket price. For lunch, you can expect a healthy meal with various options. It includes **vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options**.

## üì∏ Photos

Throughout the conference, we'll take photos and video shots. Your participation at the event represents your consent to share the materials on social media.
